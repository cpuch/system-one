## System One

System One is a WordPress plugin that adds shortcode support for displaying shows from the [System One API](https://systemonesoftware.com/).

### Installation

1. Upload the entire `system-one` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go the plugin settings page and enter your agency username.

### Usage


To display all shows, simply use this shortcode :

`[system_one]`

If you want to display shows for only a certain artist, use this shortcode instead:

`[system_one id='103876']`

where 103876 is the artist ID from System One.
