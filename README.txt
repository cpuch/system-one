Add shortcode support to display shows from the System One API.

== Description ==

Add shortcode support to display shows from the System One API.

To display all shows, simply use this shortcode :

`[system_one]`

If you want to display shows for only a certain artist, use this shortcode instead:

`[system_one id='103876']`

where 103876 is the artist ID from System One.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `system-one` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go the plugin settings page and enter your agency username.

You will find ‘System One’ menu in your WordPress admin panel.
